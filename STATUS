# TODO

- We still aren’t _quite_ 60fps. We drop frames and replay inprecisely on slower hardware or inconsistent connections. We are working on this.
- Concurrent dragging of objects doesn’t work as expected — expect object to travel at sum of vectors, but it seems glitchy. Either fix or else make so only current selection holder can drag object (I’m told this is what figma does).
- Click effects to show off 60fps
- Many unit tests aren’t working. Last-minute refactoring broke interfaces.
- We need to pull `reps/client` down into Replicache itself
- Move off of next.js it’s not doing anything for us
- It would be cool to validate the push argument types automatically somehow
- Need to compute buffers (both client and server) dynamically and per-client. Right now they are static which means either some clients will not see 60fps, or some clients will be buffered way longer than necessary.
- continuous deploy
- logging: make levels per fritz doc, make configurable
- scan not yet implemented for server side tx
